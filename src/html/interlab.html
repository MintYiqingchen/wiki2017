          Eight different plasmids, Positive Control (BBa_I20270), Negative Control (BBa_R0040), Device 1 (BBa_J364000), Device 2 (BBa_J364001), Device 3 (BBa_J364002), Device 4 (BBa_J364003), Device 5 (BBa_J364004), Device 6 (BBa_J364005) were transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α, which were inoculated on LB plate with chloramphenicol (cmr). After an overnight cultivation, single colonies was picked to keep cultivating. After 6 hours cultivation, Colony PCR was conducted to test if the plasmids were transformed successfully. And the colonies were moved into liquid cultures (LB medium) and cultivated overnight. Liquid cultures were diluted with LB medium until the value of OD600 reached 0.02. Then we took out 500 μL samples from the cultures every 2 hour (t=0, 2, 4, 6h). At last, we measured OD600 and fluorescence of all samples.

        <h4>Growth Conditions</h4>
        <p>
          The bacteria were cultivated in Lysogeny Broth(LB) plate with chloramphenicol added when doing transformation. The plates were kept at 37°C. Colonies we picked were grown in 5ml LB medium with chloramphenicol. Afterwards, they were kept at 37°C and 220 rpm shaking frequency. We used 5ml LB medium and chloramphenicol to target OD600 of 0.02.

        <p>We have used 96-well plates to do the plate reader’s measurement. A serial dilution was performed to generate a FITC fluorescence standard curve. When measuring fluorescence, the excitation wavelength we set was 480nm(9), and emission wavelength was set at 535nm(20).

          This value represents the concentration of bacteria in the medium. Due to the amount of the samples, the 0h phare failed to synchronize at the same value, and at this point the bacteria might already enter log phase. (Fig 2.)
