          <div class="medal-satisfy">Our project made it possible to combine two circuits together and build a model to predict its dynamic behaviour. This feature fit right with the engineering principle which iGEM advocates.</div>

          <div class="medal-satisfy">The software we created are tested versatilely, including Wet-Lab validation and compatibility Testing.

For example, mentor a team, characterize a part, troubleshoot a project, model/simulate a system or validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem, or be the recipient of any of these activities.</div>

          <div class="medal-requirement">Convince the judges you have thought carefully and creatively about whether your work is safe, responsible and good for the world. You could accomplish this through engaging with your local, national and/or international communities or other approaches. Please note that standard surveys will not fulfil these criteria.</div>
          <div class="medal-satisfy">This year, as we are working on our project, SYSU-Software sent a group of team members to Bio-Safety Committee office of Sun Yat-Sen University to consult the possible bio-threaten that might cause by our software and how to avoid. Therefore we developed a series of approaches preventing malicious people from creating something bad. Check SAFETY page for details.</div>

            The best way to prove a thing works is to use it by yourself, check S-Din and enjoy the convenience and swiftness bring by the best design software ever in Synthetic Biology.
            <br> The features and details of S-Din are displayed on our Wiki page. How the software work? What makes it so great? What we’ve adopted to improve User experience? What more exciting features should you expect in the future?
