          <p>
            The science research is now facing an increasingly severe problem that most researches were ignored and not evaluated properly. Numbers of research articles are published every year. How to utilize the previous work to help solve maybe part of the current problem should be considered by everyone.
          </p>
          <img src="../images/project/T--SYSU-Software--year.png" id="year-img" alt="">
          <p>
            This year, SYSU-Software try to change this situation in Synthetic Biology, exploring the treasures buried in the ocean of projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            To make full use of the works done by predecessors in Synthetic Biology. We divided it into two problems.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>How to find the project you need much faster and more accurate?</li>
            <li>How to integrate the project you find into your own work?</li>
          </ol>
          <img class="ui image centered medium" src="T--SYSU-Software--thought.png" alt="">
          <p>Follow the standardization in Synthetic Biology, we standardize the previous projects, no matter came from articles or iGEM projects, into a New data format to display you a better result when using our search engine.</p>
          <p><span class="bold">Network analysis:</span> designed to uncover the potential connection between projects, help user located exactly what they need.</p>
          <p><span class="bold">Customization:</span>The most exciting part of S-Din is that the search and the design are seamless. Once you find a project that might be useful, you can start editing in design platform as soon as you find it. Or you can just simply create one from scratch.</p>
          <p><span class="bold">Extensible:</span> To ensure the database can be updated, new information can be added by man or ‘Spider’.</p>

            <br> We made S-Din further not only satisfying the need of starting a project but choosing a project.
            <br>
            <br> Therefore, the tree of words and interaction analysis are developed to inspire users. Part of the reason we made search and design seamlessly is to enable you to start design once you catch your muse.
            <br>
            <br> S-Din is mimetic, sounds exactly when you come up with a good idea. And here comes S-Din, to inspire you, to do more in Synthetic Biology.

We‘ve always wanted to make some difference in Synthetic Biology. With the help of our search engine, our users are able to view previous projects and works at a different angle and will be inspired by it. The gap between searching and designing are now seamless. Once you catch the muse, your design can be finished instantly.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a search engine built specifically for Synthetic Biology that allow you to view previous projects and works in a standardized style. While your search, we provide network analysis services to help find your results faster and inspire you. Once you find your preferred project, you are allowed to edit it simultaneously in our design platform. More parts can be added by the search tools provided on the left or you can just drag in a circuits that you collected in your favourite before.

      <h4>Algorithm</h4>
      <div class="page-content">
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>
            The users of our software are all innovative researchers on Synthetic Biology, who are interested in many different biological fields. The purpose of our system is to recommend most related genetic parts to the users based on the research interest the users offer to our system.
          </p>
          <p>
            The information that we use to make recommendation is a database built by NLP and Random Walk which contains scores between each key word and each genetic part. Formally, it is a matrix , where is the number of key words and is the number of parts . The element at row, column is the score between the key word and genetic part , which reflects the connection between them(higher score means higher connection).
          </p>
          <p>
            The overall strategy of our system is Collaborative Filtering , i.e. we first search the similar key words in our database of the unknown word offered by users and then recommend the genetic parts which are highly related to key words that we found to the users.
          </p>
          <p>
            A natural question is how to find the most similar key words in our dataset of a given unknown word in an accurate and efficient way? Here is our general solution : To quantify the semantic similarities between words accurately ,we use technique in Deep Learning to convert words into numerical vectors and the cosine similarities between each vectors can represents the semantic similarities between words. To search the similar key words efficiently, we use the KD Tree Algorithm, a fast algorithm based on binary tree, to implement the K Nearest Neighbors strategy.

      <div class="page-content">
        <h5>Search analysis</h5>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>
            In scientific journal, keywords are often required in published articles. Keywords can be used for indexing or searching, and offer faster way for readers to know a project main work and find their interests.
          </p>
          <p>As matter of fact, in 2015, iGEM try to collect some keywords (http://2015.igem.org/Keywords) by asking teams to submit.
          </p>
          <p>
            This year, a new data format is created and keywords enable our network analysis. We first used <span>Microsoft Text Analytics Service (<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/text-analytics/">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/text-analytics/</a>)</span> to extract keywords from project wiki text in every. We only focus on the most frequent used keywords. By using machine learning, those keywords were converted to word vectors base on a semantic database. A network profiling relationship among keywords, projects and parts data is built and stored in the S-Din database. When searching something, related information will be provided to users base on the network analysis, which would spark a brand new idea expectedly.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h5>Interaction analysis</h5>
        <p>
          When you click interaction analysis on a part on the design platform, any other parts or protein that might interact with the chosen part will be displayed which can be added on the platform. We build an interaction database ourselves, the sources of data come from iGEM Registry and STRING Database. Scores for parts come from the STRING Database.

      <h4>Simulation</h4>
      <div class="page-content">
        <p>
          The users of S-Din are all active and innovative researchers in Synthetic Biology , who come up with many interesting and new ideas in a wide range of fields. Our software help them achieve their creative goals by allowing them to combine various genetic parts together to form brand-new genetic circuits that may never exist before. To help the researchers have a deeper understanding of how the genetic system that they created works , we construct an ODE system to simulate the dynamic behaviors of the genetic system mathematically. The main challenge of simulation is the uncertainty of genetic circuits since the users can construct them arbitrarily. Therefore we build a rather general model capable of simulating various genetic circuits.

              S-Din is a web application. For back-end, we choose Django with Python 3, which is fast, strong, robust and friendly to developers; MySQL with Django models binding give us fantastic database support; algorithms including Word2Vec, K-D Tree are also coded in Python 3 with the famous SciPy. For front-end, we build the view with customized Semantic UI, and control the logic behind beautiful widgets using jQuery. Some other open-source JavaScript libraries are also used to build the site, such as Chart.js for chart, jsPlumb for links in the design page, etc.. Advanced TypeScript was used to build the interesting game BioLab Rescue, hope you will enjoy it!

          Nowadays, due to the thinning of the ozone layer, the potential risk of skin cancer and cataract is growing. Our journey with S-Din begin with a curiosity of how to detect UV. But we don’t have a clear idea and don’t know where to start. Luckily, S-Din can light up one's path.

          After we constructed two plasmids, Escherichia coli DH5αwas transformed with plasmids and positive clones were identified by colony polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction endonuclease digestion.

        <h5>Experimental data</h5>
        <p>After the sequencing confirmation, Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) was transformed with plasmids. We didn’t have Liquid culture systems with UV light, so we used plate cultivation. We placed the dish on a 10-15W weak intensity UV lamp at a distance of about 30 cm, and got samples every few hours. 22 hours later, we got the blue bacteria moss (Photo.3 ). The bacteria was been broken by ultrasonic crusher, and then we use the OD588 to measure the concentration of the blue protein (Photo. 4). But unfortunately, collecting bacteria from plate may cause some system error, and because of this, our data of OD588 had poor sample reproducibility. Hence, we decided to collaborate with SCUT-China_A, , and used their data to validate our simulation.</p>
